# Vigenere-Cipher-Cryptanalysis

This is an assignment of Cryptography and Network Security Lab. Here the programs can encrypt an input along with a key given in the input.txt and key.txt file. And the Second problem can predict the key from the given ciphertext. Though it's not 100% accurate.
I have followed these 2 helpful links for cracking the cipher text without key. I followed Kasiski's method to predict the key

## Installation

Just download the project and run 27_problem1.py and 27_problem2.py 

```bash
python 27_problem1.py
python 27_problem2.py
```

## Usage
Change the input.txt for different plain text. Use larger plain text for cracking an accurate key for the 2nd problem. For using different key just change the key.txt file
